# Running

Run the backend before frontend

## Backend

The server is required for the app but the python side is only required if you plan on generating data with the tool.

### Server

```bash
cd backend
npm i
npm run start
```

### Python(for generating new continuation)

Ensure you have python3 installed

## Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```
